# Setup services
Create the service files as per the files in here. All logs are then routed to RAM

# Register and enable, e.g.,
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable beobluetooth.service
sudo systemctl start beobluetooth.service

# Control with e.g.,
sudo systemctl stop beobluetooth.service
sudo systemctl start beobluetooth.service
sudo systemctl restart beobluetooth.service

# Check status
systemctl status beobluetooth.service

# Tail logs with timestamps
journalctl -u beobluetooth.service -f -l

# Tail logs just like they would show in STDOUT
journalctl -u beobluetooth.service -f -o cat
